# react_native2_beta-hvenugopalan
This mobile application lets users set daily goals for their nutrient intake and activity, add/edit/remove exercises, and track their progress during a day. Paper prototyping was used to understand how the users would interact with the application, and Adobe XD was used later to create an interactive prototype. The application is also designed to take advantage of the accessibility features and assistive technologies of mobile platforms.
Design decisions are outlined in hvenugopalan_ReactNative1Beta.pdf and hvenugopalan_ReactNative2Beta.pdf.
